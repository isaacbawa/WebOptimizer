    <h1 class="text-primary text-center">Understanding Your Metrics</h1>
    <p class="lead text-center">Learn about the key metrics we measure to enhance your website's performance, SEO, and
        accessibility.</p>

    <section class="mt-5">
        <h2 class="text-primary">Performance Metrics</h2>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">Performance Score</h3>
            <p class="lead">This is an overall rating of a website's speed and responsiveness. A score of "0" indicates
                extremely poor performance, where users may experience slow load times or unresponsive elements. For
                instance, if a website takes more than 10 seconds to load, users are likely to abandon it, affecting
                conversions and engagement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">First Contentful Paint (FCP)</h3>
            <p class="lead">Measures the time it takes for the first visible content (text or image) to appear on the
                screen after a user requests the page. A faster FCP enhances user experience by showing that the page is
                loading. For example, users visiting an e-commerce site expect to see product images load almost
                instantly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">Speed Index</h3>
            <p class="lead">Indicates how quickly the content of a page is visibly populated during loading. A lower
                Speed Index represents a better user experience. For example, a news website with text and images that
                load within 2-3 seconds will have a good Speed Index.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</h3>
            <p class="lead">Tracks the time taken to load the largest visible element, such as a main image or header
                text. An optimal LCP is under 2.5 seconds, ensuring that key content is accessible quickly. For example,
                an online store’s banner image should load fast for shoppers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">Time to Interactive (TTI)</h3>
            <p class="lead">Measures the time it takes for a page to become fully interactive, allowing users to click,
                scroll, or input data without delay. A slow TTI frustrates users, such as when a "Buy Now" button on an
                e-commerce site remains unclickable for several seconds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">Total Blocking Time (TBT)</h3>
            <p class="lead">Represents the amount of time that the main thread of the browser is blocked, preventing
                interaction with the website. Reducing TBT is essential for smoother experiences, such as ensuring form
                submissions on a website don’t freeze temporarily.</p>

        <h2 class="text-primary">SEO Metrics</h2>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">SEO Title</h3>
            <p class="lead">The title tag of a webpage that appears in search engine results. It should be concise and
                include relevant keywords to attract clicks. For example, an SEO title for a bakery could be "Freshly
                Baked Goods - Order Online Today."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">SEO Meta Description</h3>
            <p class="lead">A brief summary of a webpage’s content shown below the title in search engine results. A
                well-crafted meta description improves click-through rates. For example, "Discover our wide range of
                organic and gluten-free bread, delivered to your doorstep."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">H1 Tags</h3>
            <p class="lead">These are the main headings on a webpage and should be clear, descriptive, and optimized for
                keywords. They guide users and search engines about the content of the page. For example, an H1 tag on a
                tech blog might be "Top 10 Smartphones of 2024."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">H2 Tags</h3>
            <p class="lead">Secondary headings that structure the content into sections, improving readability and SEO.
                For example, "Features of the Latest iPhone" under an H1 tag about smartphones.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">Canonical URL</h3>
            <p class="lead">Specifies the preferred version of a webpage, preventing duplicate content issues that could
                harm search rankings. For instance, https://example.com could be the canonical URL over
                https://example.com/index.html.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-5">
        <h2 class="text-primary">Accessibility Metrics</h2>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">Missing ARIA Roles</h3>
            <p class="lead">ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles help screen readers and other assistive
                technologies understand a webpage’s structure. Missing roles can hinder navigation for visually impaired
                users, such as failing to label a button as "Submit."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">Header Issues</h3>
            <p class="lead">Refers to problems in the structure or hierarchy of headers (H1, H2, etc.), which can
                confuse assistive technologies and users. For example, skipping from H1 to H3 without an H2 can disrupt
                the logical flow.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">Missing Alt Attributes</h3>
            <p class="lead">Alt attributes provide text descriptions for images, crucial for visually impaired users
                relying on screen readers. For example, an image of a cake should have an alt attribute like "Chocolate
                cake with strawberries."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h3 class="lead font-weight-bold">Accessibility Issues</h3>
            <p class="lead">Broadly encompasses problems like low contrast between text and background, improper use of
                ARIA roles, or missing keyboard navigation options. For example, a form that can’t be filled out using a
                keyboard excludes users with motor disabilities.</p>
